# Python Program: List Processing

This Python program processes a list of integers based on certain criteria. It ensures the input list is a multiple of 10 in length, and then it returns or prints a modified list with items removed at positions that are multiples of 2 or 3.

## Program Features

- Accepts a list of integers.
- Validates the length of the list, emitting an error message if it is not a multiple of 10.
- Returns or prints a modified list with items removed at positions that are multiples of 2 or 3.
